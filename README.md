# React Media Library

Have you ever worked with WordPress? If not, count your blessings. :)

But seriously, using a CMS like WordPress does provide a lot of useful features. 
The feature I miss most as a MERN developer is the media library browser.
All image fields are edited using a modal where you can select something previously uploaded or drag-and-drop new images
from your file browser.
Well, now you can have something similar for your React app.

Note: this only includes the UI; everybody's app is different, so I can't write your API connections for you.

## Installation

Install it via npm in your project.

```
npm install react-media-library --save
```

## Documentation / Examples
